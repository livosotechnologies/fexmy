                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The US H1B Visa is one of the most popular ways to work in the US. It is a visa that must be applied for by an employer on behalf of a specialist employee. Since the visa is granted to specialists, typically applicants hold at least a Bachelor’s degree and are from fields such as IT, finance, architecture, medicine, science etc. Fastcrop helps employers with filing for H1B petitions for their employees. We also help employees from across the world get hired by companies likely to sponsor them for an H1B visa.</p>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">US H1B Visa Details:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The H1B Visa is one of the most competitive visas to apply for. Due to there being an annual visa cap, there is a huge demand from US employers applying for this visa. Additionally, since it is a route to a Green Card, it is one of the best visas to apply to work in the US.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Under the H1B, successful petitioners can:</strong></p>

                    <li>Live and work in the US</li>
                    <li>Extend the stay in the US</li>
                    <li>Change employers during H-1B status</li>
                    <li>Stay with their dependent spouse &amp; children (aged under 21) in the US</li>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">VALIDITY OF THE VISA</h3>

                    <li>Visa has a validity of three years with the option to extend it up to a maximum of six years.</li>
                    <li>Once the validity is over, a foreign worker must either leave the U.S. or obtain a different visa.</li>
                    <li>If he does not comply, he can lose his legal status and can even be deported.</li>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">Documents Required:</h3>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">H4 Visa:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">An H4 visa is a non-immigrant dependent visa. The visa does not grant you permanent residency, but it gives you the right to live, study, and work in the US.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Who is eligible?</b></p>

                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Spouse of the H type visa holder</li>
                    <li style="text-align: justify;">Children under the age of 21 whose parent is an H visa holder</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>The validity of the H4 visa</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The validity of the visa is dependent on the visa of the sponsor who is also called the principal applicant.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The visa is usually sponsored by the spouse or parent having the H type visa. The H4 visa becomes invalid when the visa of the sponsor expires.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b> Privileges of the H4 visa</b></p>

                    <li>You can get a driver&#8217;s license</li>

                    <li>The H4 visa holder is permitted to start any form of business.</li>
                    <li>The holder of the H4 visa may continue to be eligible for EAD even if he does not seek employment.</li>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">L-1A Visa:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The L-1A Visa is a US-issued non-immigrant visa. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issues this visa for foreign directors or managers being transferred to U.S. offices of their company. International businesses that do not have associated offices in the U.S. may also use an L-1A visa to send a manager or executive to create one there.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The L-1A visa is one of two categories of work visas in the L-1 visa category. Its equivalent, the L-1B visa is for staff with advanced skills who choose to migrate to the U.S. for a five-year period. Upon expiry, the applicant may again apply for the L-1 visa holder status only after working for the parent, subsidiary, branch or affiliate of the organization for at least one year outside the U.S.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>L1 Visa Requirements:</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">There are two main requirements for an L1 visa: employer requirements and employee requirements.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Employer Requirements:</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">A qualifying relationship must be formed between the employer within the US and its international branch/subsidiary/affiliate that employs the applicant. This indicates that the two organizations are in some way tied by their ownership or association with each other.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"> Furthermore, the employer needs to be doing business in the US and at least one other country during the visa holder&#8217;s stay in the US.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Employee Requirements:</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">With an L1 visa, the applicant must have been working for the international employer for at least one year in the preceding three years before they were admitted to the U.S.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">This employment must have been in an administrative, corporate, or technical area of expertise and their prospective jobs in the U.S. must be within the same fields.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>L1A Visa to Green Card</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">An L1A visa applicant has a relatively straightforward way of acquiring a green card since it falls under an EB-1C Green Card. This does not require a PERM Labor Certificate, cutting off the processing time by up to 8 months.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The employer just needs to file an I-140 petition to qualify for the green card. If the applicant has been accepted, he files for a status adjustment (Form I-485).</p>
                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">L2 Visa:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">L2 visas are also known as L1 dependent visas. The L2 visa is granted to the spouses and dependents of L1 visa holders. An L2 visa is a non-immigrant visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>L1 dependents include:</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Spouses of visa holders</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Dependent children under the age of 21</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>L2 visa holders can:</b></p>

                    <li>Live in the U.S. temporarily</li>

                    <li>Apply for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) to work in the U.S.</li>

                    <li>Travel in and out of the US on brief international trips</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Documents required for L2 visa application:</b></p>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">R1 Visa:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">An R1 visa is for those who want to work in the United States as religious workers. It is a short-term visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Eligibility Conditions</b></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">First of all, you will have to work at a part-time job in the US, meaning that you&#8217;ll spend at least 20 hours a week at work.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">At the same time, you need to get a job that has to do with your religion. To put it another way, you have to either work in a religious position or be a minister there. This means you &#8216;re not going to be suited to R1 Visas if your work is anything other than religious.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You are also entitled if you have a bona fide religious charitable organization and you were a member of the religious community before applying for a visa and you spent at least two years in that role before applying for an R1 visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You can also be a worker for an employer who also has a religious non-profit organization in the US.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">You are not eligible if you are not going to work in a religious group or a church or is not going to do anything related to their activities. These visas are particularly for religious workers who have a job in the area, and no one else.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Being a volunteer also won&#8217;t bring an R1 Visa. You have to be a paid worker-otherwise you can&#8217;t apply.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Documents Required</b></p>

                    <li>A Nonimmigrant Visa Electronic Application (DS-160) Form</li>
                    <li>A passport valid for travel to the United States with a validity date at least six months beyond your intended period of stay.</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The R2 visa is a temporary US visa that authorizes an R1 visa holder&#8217;s spouse and unmarried child (under 21 years) to enter the US. The holders of R2 status may remain in the country for as long as the holders of R1 remain in legal status. In other words, once the principal R-1 person loses legal status, an individual loses his / her R-2 status.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>R2 visa holders can:</b></p>

                    <li>Apply for permanent residency status</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">However, the R2 visa holder cannot work in the US.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><b>Documents Required</b></p>

                    <li style="text-align: justify;">All documents required for an R-1 visa.</li>

                    <li>Conducting negotiations</li>
                    <li>For sales or investment meetings</li>
                    <li>Discuss planned investment or purchases</li>
                    <li>For business investment purposes</li>
                    <li>To attend meetings</li>
                    <li>To interview and hire staff</li>
                    <li>For research purposes</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, you should apply for the visa a minimum of 2-3 months in advance to allow for all security clearance and processing while meeting all the US business visa requirements. In some cases, there may be a personal interview as well.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The requirements for a US business visa are less stringent than those for other visas, but you must meet them to be eligible. The following are the requirements for obtaining the B1 visa:</p>

                    <li>That your visit to the United States is for business purposes.</li>
                    <li>You have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in the United States.</li>
                    <li>You intend to leave the United States as soon as your visa expires and will not return to your home country.</li>



                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">Documents Required</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since there is no quota on the B1 visa, the documentation required is not as strenuous as for migrant visas. Typically, your application package must contain:</p>

                    <li>Your passport</li>
                    <li>Proof of funds</li>
                    <li>Letters supporting your reason of visiting the US</li>
                    <li>Letter from your employer if traveling as an employee</li>
                    <li>Proof of business ownership if you are traveling as a businessperson</li>
                    <li>Insurance and other supporting documents</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p>

                    <li>Fill out the DS-160 form.</li>
                    <li>Pay the B1 visa application fees.</li>
