                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The Canada Express Entry Program relies on a points-based system to evaluate applicants.

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Candidates will be aware of the median score they should obtain in order to qualify for the ITA, if they do not make the mark, they can always make efforts to improve their CRS score or consider other CRS options.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>They can look at improving their language test results, or on gaining additional work experience, look at options to study in Canada or try for a provincial nomination.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Young candidates with a higher level of education, language proficiency in English or French or both or those with Canadian experience (employees or students) have the potential to reach a higher CRS score and get selected through the Express Entry system.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Candidates who manage to get a provincial nomination are eligible for 600 additional points. Those with a job offer in Canada or siblings residing in the country are eligible for additional points.</p>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">STEPS TO APPLY FOR THE EXPRESS ENTRY PROGRAM</h3>
                    <b>Step 1: Complete your ECA</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If you have done your education outside Canada, you should get your Educational Credentials Assessment or ECA. The ECA proves that your educational qualifications are equal to those recognized in the Canadian educational system.</p>
                    <b>Step 2: Complete your language ability tests</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The next step is completing the required English language proficiency tests. The minimum score is 6 bands in IELTS equivalent to CLB 7. Your test score should be less than 2 years old at the time of application.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You will have an edge over other applicants if you know French. French language test like the Test de evaluation de Francians (TEF) will prove your proficiency in the language.</p>
                    <b>Step 3: Create your Express Entry profile</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You will have to first create your online Express Entry profile. The profile should include details about your age, work experience, education, language skills, etc. You will be given a score base on these details.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If you qualify by getting the required points, you can submit your profile. This will be included in the Express Entry pool.</p>
                    <b> Step 4: Calculate your CRS score</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If your profile makes it to the Express Entry pool, it is ranked based on the Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. Criteria such as age, work experience, adaptability, etc. determine your CRS score. Your profile gets included in the Express Entry pool if you have the required CRS score.</p>
                    <b> Step 5: Get your Invitation to Apply (ITA)</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If your profile gets selected from the Express Entry pool, you will get an ITA from the Canadian government after which you can start the documentation for your PR visa.</p>
                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">EXPRESS ENTRY ELIGIBILITY POINTS CALCULATOR:</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The eligibility requirement for the Express Entry is 67 points out of 100. You will need to score at least 67 points under various eligibility criteria to apply for your PR visa. The Express Entry eligibility points calculator is based on the following criteria:</p>
                    <li>Age: You can score the maximum points if you are between 18-35 years. Those above this age will gain lesser points.</li>
                    <li>Education: Your minimum educational qualification must be equal to the higher secondary education level in Canada. A higher level of educational qualification means more points.</li>
                    <li>Work experience: To score the minimum points you should have at least one year of work experience. If you have more years of work experience you will gain more points.</li>
                    <li>Language ability: You must have at least 6 bands in your IELTS equivalent to CLB 7 to be eligible to apply and score the minimum points. Higher scores mean more points.</li>
                    <li>Adaptability: You can score ten points on the adaptability factor if your family members or close relatives are living in Canada and will be able to support you when you move in there. You can also gain points if your spouse or legal partner is ready to migrate with you to Canada.</li>
                    <li>Arranged employment: A valid job offer from a Canadian employer entitles you for ten points.</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You need to have a minimum of 67 points out of 100 to be eligible to apply under the Express Entry program.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The Canada Express Entry process follows a points-based system for classifying applicants seeking to settle in Canada. The points are awarded to clients based on a Comprehensive Ranking System or CRS. Points are given to applicants based on skills, experience, Canadian employment status and provincial/territorial nomination. The higher the points, the greater are the chances of getting an invitation to apply (ITA) for permanent residency in Canada.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Based on the Express Entry points system, every Express Entry draw has a minimum cutoff score. These draws are held at regular intervals. Those applicants with a CRS score equal or above the cutoff score will receive an ITA. If more than one candidate has a score equal to the cutoff score, the one with a long presence in the Express Entry pool will receive an ITA.</p>

                    <br>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">NEXT STEPS AFTER GETTING AN ITA</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Once you receive an ITA, you will have to submit a complete and correct application for which you will be given 90 days. If you fail to do so within 90 days, then your invitation will become null and void. So, you should make the best use of this time to submit an accurate application.</p>
                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">SUBMIT A COMPLETE APPLICATION</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Documents: The first step is to gather all the required documents. Through the ITA you will know under which program you have been selected to apply for your PR visa- CEC or any other Express Entry program. If you check the Express Entry portal, you will find a list of documents that is specific to the program you have applied for. You will have to submit these documents with your application, the documents can include:</p>
                    <li>Documents supporting your English language test results</li>
                    <li>Civil status documents such as your birth certificate</li>
                    <li>Documents in proof of your education achievements</li>
                    <li>Documents in proof of your work experience</li>
                    <li>Medical certificate</li>
                    <li>Police clearance certificate</li>
                    <li>Proof of funds</li>
                    <li>Photos</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You will also have to provide a medical certificate from a doctor approved by the IRCC.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Based on your situation, you will be required to submit additional documents, ensure that you have all of them ready.</p>
