                    <p class="pt-3 pb-3">
                        Offshore companies are an appealing structure that is relatively inexpensive (in comparison to the other types of legal entities available in the UAE) for foreign investors looking to form entities for the purposes of holding capital or assets both inside and outside the UAE or conducting business outside the UAE.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-3">
                        An offshore firm differs greatly from a free zone corporation in how it does business. An offshore corporation is a legal corporate entity formed with the intention of conducting business outside of the nation in which it was formed and/or the location of its ultimate ownership.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pb-3">
                        Offshore businesses in the UAE, in general, are not subject to corporate income tax; they provide business flexibility and anonymity at a lower relative cost (for example, an offshore business is not required to maintain an office space; and they provide asset protection for real estate purchased in the UAE).

                    RAK Offshore Company Formation

                    The UAE RAK Offshore Company is inexpensive, cost-effective, and well-known in the region. When it comes to international business, RAK is the most cost-effective offshore in the UAE and the greatest alternative accessible because the RAK offshore company registration process is quick and straightforward. RAK offshore companies do not have a physical office in RAK and are not permitted to conduct business in the UAE. However, they can enjoy full tax exemption and full access to firm profits while maintaining complete privacy, confidentiality, and asset and information protection. A registered agent is required for RAK offshore company registration, and his office might be the firm’s registered office.

                                            <p>There are many differences between a Offshore Company and other forms of business setup in RAK. Firstly, Offshore companies are allowed to do business anywhere in the RAK and outside the RAK.</p>
                                            <p>Previously foreign investors or entrepreneurs were not allowed to form a business in the RAK Offshore with 100% ownership. It was mandatory to have a local sponsor with 51% of company shares allotted to them. This obligation has been revoked as per the new Dubai company law. This allows foreign entrepreneurs to own 100% of their company shares in the Dubai Offshore.</p>
                                            <p>Another major advantage differentiating Offshore companies from others is the office space requirement and setup. Physical office space is required to obtain a Offshore business setup license in RAK. Offshore businesses have the advantage of setting up office spaces anywhere that suits them.</p>
                                            <p>Offshore companies also do not have any restrictions when it comes to visa eligibility. The number of visas issued is directly proportional to the area of workspace/office space that the company has.</p>
                                            <p>RAK Offshore companies also have business aids, tax exemptions, and other benefits in compliance with the latest laws.</p>
