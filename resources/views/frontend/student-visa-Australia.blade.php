                    <p>Australia has some of the world’s best-ranked universities. The Australian Universities offer a
                        wide range of courses in a variety of subjects. The tuition fees here are affordable compared to

                        valid for up to four years. This can act as a pathway to permanent residency in Australia.</p>

                        recognized all over the world. Another advantage of studying in Australia is the low cost of

                        studying which can help them meet part of the tuition fees. They also have access to
                        scholarships which can lower their costs of a course.</p>
                    <p>Many students opt to study in Australia because its growing economy promises good job
