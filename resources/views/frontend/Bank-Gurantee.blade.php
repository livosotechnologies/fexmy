                        After acquiring a licence, opening a bank account is a crucial next step for any business. We can assist you with banking in Dubai or with opening an account. We can assist freezone companies as well as mainland corporations in opening bank accounts in the UAE thanks to our ties with numerous institutions.

                        Among other things, banks have various criteria for paperwork, minimum balances, and sector-specific expertise. The strategy may change based on the circumstances. We may offer a list of appropriate and reputable banks to our clients based on their requirements and preferences.

                        Depending on elements including the nature of the business, the domicile of operation (free zone/offshore or mainland), and the nationality of the signatory, an account may be opened within a specific amount of time. For instance, in the mainland, General Trading needs compliance approval before opening an account. Because of this, opening a bank account requires more time.

                                        <p>There are many differences between a FreeZone company and other forms of business setup in Sharjah. Firstly, FreeZone companies are allowed to do business anywhere in the Sharjah and outside the Sharjah.</p>
                                        <p>Previously foreign investors or entrepreneurs were not allowed to form a business in the Sharjah FreeZone with 100% ownership. It was mandatory to have a local sponsor with 51% of company shares allotted to them. This obligation has been revoked as per the new Dubai company law. This allows foreign entrepreneurs to own 100% of their company shares in the Dubai FreeZone.</p>
                                        <p>Another major advantage differentiating FreeZone companies from others is the office space requirement and setup. Physical office space is required to obtain a FreeZone business setup license in Sharjah. FreeZone businesses have the advantage of setting up office spaces anywhere that suits them.</p>
                                        <p>FreeZone companies also do not have any restrictions when it comes to visa eligibility. The number of visas issued is directly proportional to the area of workspace/office space that the company has.</p>
                                        <p>Sharjah FreeZone companies also have business aids, tax exemptions, and other benefits in compliance with the latest laws.</p>
