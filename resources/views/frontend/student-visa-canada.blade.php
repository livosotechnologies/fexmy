                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3"> WHY STUDY IN CANADA?</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Canada is one of the best places for higher studies and the country attracts thousands of students each year from all over the world. Canada universities provide world class education which are recognized globally and research is considered one of the key components of any graduate course. The universities support students who come out with best research ideas and scholarships are provided according to the research work. Here are also some other reasons to study in Canada:</p>

                    <li>Affordable Education</li>
                    <li>Innovative and Abundant Research Opportunities</li>
                    <li>Immigration Possibilities</li>
                    <li>Exciting Campus Lifestyle</li>
                    <li>Healthy and Safe Communities</li>
                    <li>Work and internship opportunities for international students while they study</li>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">SOME OTHER PERTINENT REASONS FOR CHOOSING CANADA INCLUDE:</h3>

                    <li><b>Numerous research opportunities</b> – Universities here provide research support to students who can provide good research ideas.</li>
                    <li><b>Possibility of immigration after completing the course</b> – If a candidate decides to study in Canada, he will gain points in three areas: language, education, and work. There will be some additional points if they fall under a certain age group. An education in Canada can give valuable points for various immigration streams such as Express Entry or PNP streams.</li>
                    <b>Vibrant campus atmosphere</b>

                    <li><b>International students have the option of working while studying</b> – Canada provides the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) which helps foreign students obtain job experience in Canada after completing their course of study at a designated learning institute (DLI). The PGWP is valid for three years, depending on the study program’s duration.</li>
                    <b>Good internship opportunities</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:</h3>
                    <b>Educational Qualification</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The minimum eligibility criteria to graduate is you have to score at least 50% from a UGC or AICTE recognized university.</p>
                    <b>Year Back</b>
                    <li>The graduation degree has to be completed within the stipulated time with no gap year.</li>
                    <li>Example: B.Com is a 3-year degree. The client should have completed it within 3 years and not more.</li>
                    <li>Example: Engineering is a 4-year degree. The client should have completed within 4 years and not more.</li>
                    <b>Backlogs</b>

                        <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The Canadian government offers options for international students to stay after their course and gain some work experience. The Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) provides the Post-Graduate Work Permit Program. Under this program, international graduates can get an open work permit valid for three years. With this permit Canadian employers can work for any employer without the need of having a job offer before making an application.</p>
