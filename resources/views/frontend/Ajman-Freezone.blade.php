                                        <p>There are many differences between a FreeZone company and other forms of business setup in Ajman. Firstly, FreeZone companies are allowed to do business anywhere in the Ajman and outside the Ajman.</p>
                                        <p>Previously foreign investors or entrepreneurs were not allowed to form a business in the Ajman FreeZone with 100% ownership. It was mandatory to have a local sponsor with 51% of company shares allotted to them. This obligation has been revoked as per the new Dubai company law. This allows foreign entrepreneurs to own 100% of their company shares in the Dubai FreeZone.</p>
                                        <p>Another major advantage differentiating FreeZone companies from others is the office space requirement and setup. Physical office space is required to obtain a FreeZone business setup license in Ajman. FreeZone businesses have the advantage of setting up office spaces anywhere that suits them.</p>
                                        <p>FreeZone companies also do not have any restrictions when it comes to visa eligibility. The number of visas issued is directly proportional to the area of workspace/office space that the company has.</p>
                                        <p>Ajman FreeZone companies also have business aids, tax exemptions, and other benefits in compliance with the latest laws.</p>
