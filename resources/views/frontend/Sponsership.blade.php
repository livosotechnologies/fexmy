                    Setting Up Your UAE Company Starts with Fexmy                    </h3>
                    <p class="pt-3 pb-2">
                    ne of the most common questions asked by first-time entrepreneurs in this part of the world is whether they need a local sponsor (Nominee Shareholder) in Dubai. The answer depends on many factors, including your nationality and the type of business you wish to set up.              
                      </p>
                    <p class="pb-2">
                    If you’re a non-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) national looking to set up a business with a commercial or industrial licence on the United Arab Emirates mainland, then yes, you will need a local sponsor as a business partner. If, however, you are setting up in a free zone, or your business activity is covered by a professional services licence, a local sponsor is not required.

<p>Professional license in Dubai, UAE refers to the type of license which permits professionals to start a business in the Emirates. Unlike other trade licenses, a professional license holder can do business in particular types of industries; Carpentry, Artisanship, Consultancy services, Printing and Publishing, Beauty saloons, Repair services, etc come under the professional license services in Dubai and UAE.</p>
<p class="mt-2">In short, a professional license is given to an individual or a single-ownership company to do any profession in which he/she delivers services based on their intellectual or artistic talent. However, if the business has more than one owner, it will be called a civil company. At Kiltons, we offer services to get a professional license in Dubai.</p>

                <p class="lead mb-5">
                First, you’ll need to establish a mainland Limited Liability Company (LLC)—of which you retain 49% ownership with the other 51% going to the local sponsor. Rest assured, however, that profits are not split along the same lines and your local partner will have little-to-no say in the day-to-day running of your company.                </p>
                <p class="lead mb-5">
                Finding a local sponsor in Dubai, can be a demanding process for startups and new entrepreneurs. The local sponsor must either be a UAE national (also knows as an Emirati) or a corporate entity. The corporate entity must be completely owned by UAE nationals and comprised of a board of directors.

                                        <p>There are many differences between a FreeZone company and other forms of business setup in Sharjah. Firstly, FreeZone companies are allowed to do business anywhere in the Sharjah and outside the Sharjah.</p>
                                        <p>Previously foreign investors or entrepreneurs were not allowed to form a business in the Sharjah FreeZone with 100% ownership. It was mandatory to have a local sponsor with 51% of company shares allotted to them. This obligation has been revoked as per the new Dubai company law. This allows foreign entrepreneurs to own 100% of their company shares in the Dubai FreeZone.</p>
                                        <p>Another major advantage differentiating FreeZone companies from others is the office space requirement and setup. Physical office space is required to obtain a FreeZone business setup license in Sharjah. FreeZone businesses have the advantage of setting up office spaces anywhere that suits them.</p>
                                        <p>FreeZone companies also do not have any restrictions when it comes to visa eligibility. The number of visas issued is directly proportional to the area of workspace/office space that the company has.</p>
                                        <p>Sharjah FreeZone companies also have business aids, tax exemptions, and other benefits in compliance with the latest laws.</p>
