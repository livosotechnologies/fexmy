                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-4"> CANADA VISIT VISA DETAILS</h3>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The Canada Visit Visa is a straightforward visa application giving you the ability to visit Canada for a period of up to 6 months. Single entry visas and multiple entry visas are the two types of Canada visas available in Canada. Foreign nationals can only enter Canada once with a single-entry visa. A multiple entry visa permits its holder to come and go as often as they desire while the visa is valid. You do not have to pick the type of visitor visa to apply for; all applicants are automatically considered for multiple entry visas, and single-entry visas are only awarded in exceptional circumstances.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Multiple entry visitor visas allow the holder to visit Canada as many times as they wish for six months at a time as long as the visa is valid.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Key points to note about this visa are:</p>

                    <li>It can only be used for leisure or tourism purposes</li>
                    <li>You cannot use this visa to work or to apply for work</li>
                    <li>You can take your dependents and children along</li>
                    <li>Typically, the visit visa is issued in 27 days after submission</li>
                    <br>
