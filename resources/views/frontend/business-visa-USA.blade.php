                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">US B1 Visa Details</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The B1 Visa is used by visitors for a wide variety of business activities. It is used by businesspersons and executives visiting the US for purposes such as:</p>

                    <li>Conducting negotiations</li>
                    <li>For sales or investment meetings</li>
                    <li>Discuss planned investment or purchases</li>
                    <li>For business investment purposes</li>
                    <li>To attend meetings</li>
                    <li>To interview and hire staff</li>
                    <li>For research purposes</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Ideally, you should apply for the visa a minimum of 2-3 months in advance to allow for all security clearance and processing while meeting all the US business visa requirements. In some cases, there may be a personal interview as well.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS</strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">The requirements for a US business visa are less stringent than those for other visas, but you must meet them to be eligible. The following are the requirements for obtaining the B1 visa:</p>

                    <li>That your visit to the United States is for business purposes.</li>
                    <li>You have sufficient funds to support yourself during your stay in the United States.</li>
                    <li>You intend to leave the United States as soon as your visa expires and will not return to your home country.</li>



                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">Documents Required</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since there is no quota on the B1 visa, the documentation required is not as strenuous as for migrant visas. Typically, your application package must contain:</p>

                    <li>Your passport</li>
                    <li>Proof of funds</li>

                    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>APPLICATION PROCESS</strong></p>
