                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>In this year, there will be major opportunities for UK immigration. The country plans new routes such as Global Business Mobility and Scale-up. It will introduce new visa categories and consolidate or modify some existing offerings. The new High Potential Individual visa would provide user-friendly access.</p>
                    <li><strong>High Potential Individual route</strong>: It is a visa for students who have graduated from a top global university. It allows them to enter the UK without a job offer and work without restrictions, offering them the possibility to settle in the country if they meet certain criteria.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scale-up route</strong>: It is a visa for talented candidates having a job offer from a qualified scale-up.</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;><strong><br />Simplifying the Innovator route: </strong>Introduction of a fast-track program for businesses with growth potential</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Allowing more flexible options for funding and an opportunity for the applicant to work outside the primary business</p>
                    <li><strong>Global Business Mobility:</strong> New Global Business Mobility route for overseas businesses</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The UK government has laid out all these plans as it aims to make the UK a global innovation hub by 2035. The introduction of this new fast-track visa for recruiting overseas talent would be &#8220;very important or vital&#8221; for the growth of its economy and employment.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Apart from these, the country is also facing labor shortages in many areas and hence it will rely on UK immigration for highly skilled foreign nationals.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The UK government urges skilled professionals to work in the UK under the Tier 2 visa program to gain a competitive edge. This program allows job seekers to check the occupations in the Tier 2 Shortage Occupation List and apply for them based on their eligibility criteria.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The most in-demand sectors include:</p>

                    <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">New UK immigration points-based assessment system</h3>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The UK launched the new UK immigration points-based system in January 2021. The eligibility criteria for the UK skilled migration depend on the &#8216;new points-based UK Visa system.&#8217; It measures eligibility by taking into consideration various factors to assess candidates&#8217; skills for the UK work visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The points scored based on the UK New Points-based System<strong> </strong>decide the eligibility for the work visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>To qualify for the UK work visa, the candidate should score a minimum of 70 points. If the candidate has an approved job offer for a skilled job and can speak fluent English, she/he will be awarded 50 points.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The candidate can gain the remaining 20 points if the salary being offered is at least £25,600 per year. The candidates can earn extra points if they have higher qualifications:</p>
                    <li>10 points for a relevant PhD</li>
                    <li>20 points for a PhD in Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) disciplines</li>
                    <li>20 points for a job offer in the skill shortages stream</li>
                    <li>Few jobs such as health or education will earn them 20 points even if their pay is less than £25,600</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;><strong>UK Skilled Worker Visa<br /></strong>The UK Skilled Worker Visa is what you need if you are a non-EU national as well as a skilled professional wanting to reside and be employed in the UK.
