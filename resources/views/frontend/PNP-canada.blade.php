                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Looking to relocate to Canada quickly and get on track for a PR? The Canada Provincial Nominee Program is an accessible way to settle in Canada. Under the Provincial Nominee Program Canadian provinces and territories can nominate individuals for a Canadian Permanent Residency. While the PNP program is separate from the Express Entry program, it does offer applicants holding a select PNP an additional 600 CRS points when they enter the Express Entry pool. Several PNP programs have sent Letters of Interest to applicants with CRS scores under 400 as well. Fexmy can help you take advantage of this huge opportunity to migrate to Canada with our dedicated visa and immigration support.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>What is the full form of PNP?</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>PNP is short for the Provincial Nominee Program, which allows people to migrate to a particular province or territory of Canada. </p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>In order to emigrate to a particular province or territory of Canada, apply only in that place. Before applying, make sure you have the skills, work experience, and educational qualifications needed for the job vacancies in that province or territory.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>After that, the province/territory will evaluate if you fulfill their job market requirements. If they find your profile suitable, they will inform you how much time it will take to process the application.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Once your application gets a thumbs-up from the province or territory, you need to apply for permanent residence within the time frame they fix it. The province/territory will also inform you if you have to apply via the Express Entry system or by means of the regular application procedure.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Through an Express Entry PNP path: If you have not enrolled in the Express Entry pool, you have to complete an Express Entry profile so that you are admitted into the pool. If not, you can commence it by using the government of Canada portal.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Through a non-Express Entry PNP path: Applicants of permanent residency who have been nominated through a non-Express Entry PNP stream need to apply for the same through the regular application process.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The Canada Provincial Nominee Program was created to attract skilled international talent to Canada provinces facing a talent shortage. Thousands of successful applicants have relocated and permanently settled in Canada through the PNP program. Some of the best Canadian provinces to apply to under this program are:</p>

                    <li>Prince Edward Island</li>
                    <li>Ontario</li>
                    <li>Saskatchewan</li>
                    <li>Manitoba</li>
                    <li>Nova Scotia</li>
                    <li>Alberta</li>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If you are a skilled professional with experience in technology, finance, education, marketing or healthcare, now is the perfect time to explore your options through the PNP program.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You can apply under the PNP option to migrate to Canada if you want to live in a province, contribute to its economy and wish to become a permanent resident of Canada.</p>
                    <b>Options in the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP)</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>There are two options when filling an application through the PNP program:</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>1.Paper based process</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>2.Through Experss Entry</p>
                    <b> Paper based process:</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The first step is to apply to the province or territory for nomination under the non-Express Entry stream. If you meet the eligibility requirements and qualify through the individual In-demand Occupation Lists of some provinces, you will get a nomination from the province if your occupation is on the list. You can then apply for a Canada PR Visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You will now have to submit a paper application for your PR visa. The processing time is usually longer than through the Express Entry system.</p>
                    <b>Express Entry System:</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>There are 2 ways to apply:</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You can apply for a nomination by contacting the province or territory and apply for a nomination under the Express Entry stream.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>If you get a positive response from the province or territory to nominate you, you can create an Express Entry profile or update your profile if it already exists.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The other option is to create an Express Entry profile and indicate the provinces or territories you are interested in. If the province sends a ‘notification of interest’ you can then contact them and then apply through the Express Entry system.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>You must meet the eligibility requirements for a successful outcome of your application.</p>
                    <b>Steps in PNP application for PR visa:</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>1.Apply in the province or region where you desire to settle.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>2.If your profile meets the eligibility criteria, you could be nominated by the province to apply for a PR visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>3.Apply for your PR visa after you are nominated by a province.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>The criteria for evaluating the PR application varies from province to province.</p>

                    <b>Features of the Provincial nominee program:</b>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Canada offers nearly 80 different PNPs which have their individual eligibility requirements. The PNP program allows provinces to meet their individual immigration needs by helping them fill jobs that are in demand and meet labor shortages in their province.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Most PNPs require applicants to have some connection to the province. They should have either worked earlier in that province or studied there. Or they should have a job offer from an employer in the province for a job visa.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>A provincial nomination can help you in two ways to get your PR visa. It can add 600 CRS points to your Express Entry application and makes you eligible to apply for your PR visa directly to IRCC.</p>
