                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">TYPES OF GERMAN STUDENT VISAS</h3>
                        <p>Here are the various types of Germany study visa.</p>
                        <p>German Language Course Visa: This visa is for learning the German language while living in Germany. This visa is issued to foreigners for the purpose of completing an intensive language course that is between 3 to 12 months in duration.</p>
                        <p>Student Applicant Visa: This is for international students that –</p>
                        <p>Have applied for university courses,</p>
                        <p>In many such cases, additional admission requirements have to be complied with – attending an interview or clearing an examination – for the enrollment to be confirmed.</p>
                        <p>Simply put, the student applicant visa is specifically for those international students that are required to be in Germany for appearing for entrance exams for the university that they have applied to.</p>
                        <p>Validity of this visa is 3 months. An extension of 6 more months can be given. You can live in Germany for a total of 9 months on a student applicant visa. If, by the end of the 9 months’ allotted duration, you have not secured admission to any institution, you will be required to leave Germany.</p>
                        <p>If, on the other hand, you are successful in gaining admission into a university in Germany, you will have to apply for a student visa instead.</p>
                        <p>Student Visa: You will have to apply for a German student visa if you have already been accepted to a German university.</p>
                        <p>The Germany student visa is the standard visa for international students who have been formally admitted to a university in Germany and are ready to commence with their full-time studies in the country.</p>
                        <p><strong>WORK AUTHORIZATION FOR STUDENTS </strong></p>
                        <p>Student Applicant: Over 60% of international students in Germany opt to work part-time towards covering their living expenses.</p>
                        <p>Ways of financing studies in Germany include scholarships, parental income, student loans, personal savings and working part-time.</p>
                        <p>For the student applicant, the work authorization is as given below –</p>
                        <p>The student must be over 18 years of age</p>
                        <p>International students in Germany are allowed to work for up to 120 full days or 240 half days of the year.</p>
                        <p>Do note that a job as a research assistant or student assistant at your university will not be counted towards your limit.</p>
                        <p>Overseas students on a Germany student visa can work full-time in Germany during their regular university breaks.</p>
                        <p>They can also work additional hours if their job can be considered to be mandatory work under certain regulations.</p>
                        <p>An internship during semester break, even if unpaid, will be regarded as normal work and subtracted from the 120-day credit balance.</p>
                        <p>Required mandatory internships that are part of the course do not count.</p>
                        <p>Non-EU students are not allowed to work as a freelancer or be self-employed when they study in Germany.</p>
                        <p>Those aiming to work longer than the 120-day limit must take specific permission for the same. The foreigner’s registration office [Ausländerbehörde] and the local employment agency [Agentur fur Arbeit] issue these permissions.</p>
                        <p>The recommended course of action for anyone looking at part-time work while studying abroad in Germany would be to find a job that is related to their field of study.</p>
                        <p>This way, not only do they stand to gain in terms of covering their living expenses, but they can also use the work experience gained to add credits to their studies.</p>
                        <p>Spouse: In general, spouses are given the same rights as the spouse is already in Germany. Therefore, if the student in Germany has the right to work, the spouse who comes to join him or her will also have that right. But also note that only work permit holders can apply for the dependent visas.</p>

                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">GERMAN STUDENT VISA REQUIREMENTS:</h3>

                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">AFTER YOU GRADUATE</h3>
                        <p>Upon completing their studies in Germany, students can apply for and get a residence permit of 18 months to look for a job as per their qualification from a German university.</p>
                        <p>As soon as a student gets a job offer, he can choose either to apply for a German residence permit or a European Union Blue Card for the next part of their stay.</p>
                        <p>Students may get a residence permit even if they get a job offer for a part-time employment, provided that the expected salary secures all the means of subsistence.</p>
                        <p>If a student wants to stay in Germany and become a permanent resident, he can apply for a ‘settlement permit’ as early as two years after receiving the permanent residence permit or EU Blue Card.</p>

                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">WORK OPPORTUNITIES AFTER GRADUATION</h3>
                        <p>The right university degree is quite essential for securing a high-paying job in Germany.</p>
                        <p>For an international worker seeking employment in Germany, the major sectors to consider are – IT, coal, machine tools, textiles, engineering, electronics, chemicals, machinery, shipbuilding, vehicles, food and beverages.</p>
                        <p>Recent growth areas in Germany include the automotive industry, high-tech manufactured products, telecoms, banking and tourism.</p>


                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">CAN THE STUDENTS APPLY FOR A PR VISA UPON GRADUATION?</h3>

                        <p>As a student with a Germany student visa, if you wish to stay in Germany after you finish your course, you will need to get the German Permanent Residence Permit, also referred to as the Settlement Permit or the Niederlassungserlaubnis in German.</p>
                        <p>The permanent residence permit lets you work in Germany. You can also travel in and out of the country.</p>
                        <p>The Niederlassungserlaubnis is usually given to people who have either the EU Blue Card or have held the temporary residence permit for some years. To be eligible for the permanent residence permit, such people must prove the following:</p>
                        <p>That they have worked in Germany for at least 5 years</p>
                        <p>That their job has the approval of the Federal Employment Agency</p>
                        <p>That they have paid the necessary taxes and cleared other contributions to the German government</p>
                        <p>Moreover, knowledge of some advanced German language is also necessary at this stage, as the requirements for German language proficiency are more stringent for the permanent residence permit than for the Student visa.</p>
                        <p>Once you have the permanent residence permit, your spouse and children will be allowed to join you in Germany. Initially, they will be given a temporary residence permit. After a few years, your family can get a permanent residence permit as well.</p>


                        <h3 class="sec-title pt-3 pb-3">REQUIREMENTS TO BE FULFILLED FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR A RESIDENCE PERMIT:</h3>
