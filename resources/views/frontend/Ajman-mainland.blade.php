                                        <p>There are many differences between a mainland company and other forms of business setup in Ajman. Firstly, Mainland companies are allowed to do business anywhere in the UAE and outside the UAE.</p>
                                        <p>Previously foreign investors or entrepreneurs were not allowed to form a business in the UAE mainland with 100% ownership. It was mandatory to have a local sponsor with 51% of company shares allotted to them. This obligation has been revoked as per the new UAE company law. This allows foreign entrepreneurs to own 100% of their company shares in the UAE mainland.</p>
                                        <p>Another major advantage differentiating mainland companies from others is the office space requirement and setup. Physical office space is required to obtain a mainland business setup license in Ajman. Mainland businesses have the advantage of setting up office spaces anywhere that suits them.</p>
                                        <p>Mainland companies also do not have any restrictions when it comes to visa eligibility. The number of visas issued is directly proportional to the area of workspace/office space that the company has.</p>
                                        <p>UAE mainland companies also have business aids, tax exemptions, and other benefits in compliance with the latest laws.</p>
