                    <b>What is the salary of a CA in Dubai? </b>


                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>CA, short for Chartered Accountant, earns up to an average annual salary of AED 117,110 in Dubai, equivalent to US$326.5. The salary includes allowances for accommodation, travel, and other essentials.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Since Dubai is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a Gulf nation, and a conservative nation, there could be disparities in salaries for males and females. That said, the salaries of Chartered Accountants depend on an applicant’s work experience, aptitude, and few other criteria. </p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify" ;>Of all the above measures, experience plays a major role. Of course, educational levels also play a vital role.
