                    <p>Australia’s Global Talent Independent Program is also referred to as the Global Talent Visa Program.</p>
                    <p>With the global competition for talent ever-intensifying, Australia is working towards attracting the best and the brightest to the country, for helping grow a stronger economy.</p>
                    <p>The Australian government has dedicated talent attraction programs designed for turbocharging the Australian economy.</p>
                    <p>Exceptionally talented individuals and high-value businesses are being specifically targeted by Australia. With the individuals and businesses that come to Australia, their capital, ideals as well as networks too find inroads into the country.</p>
                    <p>The GTI Program of the Australian government creates a streamlined Australia immigration pathway for highly-skilled professionals to come to the country for working and living on a permanent basis.</p>
                    <p>10 future-focused sectors are covered under Australia&#8217;s GTI Program.</p>
                    <p>Designed for helping grow innovation and tech economies, the GTI Program will be creating opportunities for Australians – through the transfer of skills, promotion of innovation, as well as the creation of jobs in Australia.</p>
                    <p>Australia is one of the most culturally diverse countries worldwide, often dubbed to be a “lifestyle destination” and cosmopolitan to the core.</p>
                    <p>In addition to a business-friendly approach of the government and strong trading links, Australia also offers a wide range in opportunities for innovation.</p>
                    <p>Through the GTI Program, the Australian government will be granting Australian permanent residency visas for making new lives in the Land Down Under.</p>
